| Random Forest   | 96.02%    | 80.74% | 86.94%   |
| XGBoost         | 95.83%    | 86.10% | 90.33%   |

| Naive Bayes     | 52.35%    | 28.10% | 30.53%   |

| Model/Micro Avg | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| --------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Decision Tree   | 95.41%    | 95.38% | 95.39%   |
| Random Forest   | 97.39%    | 97.39% | 97.22%   |
| XGBoost         | 98.06%    | 98.09% | 97.99%   |
| LightGBM        | 97.75%    | 97.82% | 97.71%   |
| SVM             | 96.76%    | 96.80% | 96.57%   |
| Naive Bayes     | 79.10%    | 82.96% | 78.93%   |

The dataset is highly unbalanced, so using the macro average as an observation is more meaningful.
